#  clear mingw perl from path??


./configure --with-curl=no --with-perl

#  now edit the files as per https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/BuildingWithMinGW
#  1.
#  change all $(GDAL_ROOT) in GNUmakefile to '.'
#  otherwise some commands get too long
#  and the system fails, saying it cannot find a .o file (that actually exists)
#  Could just set GDAL_ROOT=.?

#sed -i -e 's/\$\(GDAL_ROOT\)/\./g' GNUmakefile
sed -i -e 's|\$\(GDAL_ROOT\)|\.|g' GNUmakefile


#  should probably change this line in cpl_config.h
# /* The size of `long', as computed by sizeof. */
# /* #undef SIZEOF_LONG */
#define SIZEOF_LONG 4

#  2.
#  skip expat steps for now - should already point to strawberry perl's version
#  3.
#  skip the gtk steps unless it is in the path
#  4.
#  skip the misc section for now as we seem to get the same answers as in that wiki page
#  except SIZEOF_VOIDP, but poss that's due to x64?  Leaving at 8 for now.  

make -j4

#  and wait a while........
